Scanner Class :
Helps us take the input from keyboard

Logical Operators:
   Just another set of symbol that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
   There are three logical operators ! || &&

   Why we should learn about the logical operators?
     We can greatly simplify th
     s logical if we use the these operators

     What is the Syntax?
      they only work with the boolean data type
      if(!condition)
      if(condition1 || condition2)
      if( condition1 &&  condition2)


NOT Operators(!)
      Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is true it will make false
      if something false it will make it true.



What is a SwitchCase statement?
   Switch case statement are just another of achieving the same result as if -else if condition

 Why should we learn about them
    The reason we should use them is they are  very fast

    Striing(var)
    switch(var){
    case 1:
    sout"1"
    break;

    } that

    Rules that we should follow:
    we can only use byte short int char String in switch case statement
    we cant use relational operation in  switch case statement

    Why should we learn about the logical operators?
        we can greatly simplify th

    What is the syntax:

        if(! condition)
        if(condition1 || condition 2)
        if(conditions1 && condition2)

    NOT Operator (!)
        Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is  it will make it false if something
        is false it will make it true.

    What is a SwitchCase statement:
        Switch case statement are just another of achieving the same results as if-else-if conditions.

    Why should we learn about them:
        The reason we should use them is they are very fast.
    Syntax:

    switch ( condition) {
    case 1:
    {output}
    break;
    case 2:
    {output}
    break;
    default:
    {otherwise output}

    }
    Rules that we should follow:
        1) we can only use byte short int char String in switch case statements.
        2) We can't use relational operators in switch case statements are also not allowed
        3) We can't use logical operators
