Operators:
   Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition
    Compare things if two entities are same or not if a number greater than other number or not
    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical
    operators
    Arithmetic Operators:
    we use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations.Like addition, subtraction etc.
    + => Addition
    - => Subtraction
    / => Division
    * => Multiplication
    % => Modulus, remainder

    Relational Operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger than
    other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not
    ==  =>  used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we got true otherwise we get false.
    !=  => used check if two variables don't contain the same value, we get a true if they are not same
    >   => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true
    <   => used to check if one value is smaller than value on right side we will get true
    >=  => if the value on left is greater than value on right side or if they are same we will get a true
    <=  => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other

     Conditional Construction:
     Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on condition if condition is true that java execute
     code otherwise it skips that code
     How to write IfElse Condition:
     if(condition){
     any line of code even another if condition

     if(){

     }
     }
     Important Notes:
     1) for String we use equals method instead of === sign because it is a non-primitive data type
     2) We can command +opt+L(Mac) ctrl +alt+L(windows) to format our code
     3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part

  if else condition:
    When I have to test the same variables for multiples conditions I should use If else if.
    When I have to multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions

    Operators:
        Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can
        compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.

    Relational operators.
        Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger than
        other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
        ==  => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
        !=  => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
        >   => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true.
        <   => opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a true.
        >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true.
        <=  => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.
    Conditional constructs
    Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condtion if codnition is true that java execute
    the code otherwise it skips that code.
    How to write Ifelse conditions:
        if(condition){
        any line of code even another if condition

        if(){
        }

        }

    Important Notes:
        1) For String we use equals method instead of === sign because it s a non-primitive data type
        2) We can cmd+opt+l(Mac) ctrl+alt+l(windows) to format our code.
        3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

    If else conditions
        When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions i should use If else if
        When we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
